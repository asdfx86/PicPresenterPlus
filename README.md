# Introduction
TODO: Give a short introduction of your project. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project.

Just a little project I'm making.. An extension of the Picture Viewer Tutorial available on [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd492135.aspx). Added features include Dual Screen View.

# What I've Done So Far
- Dual Screen View on another form.
- Memory management optimizations.

# Where to next
- We will make a playlist of pictures, drag and drop...  Add video functionality... The possibilities are endless.
- Graphics, styled text (outline, shadow, gradient fill, glow, 3D, etc...)
- Gapless audio, seamless playback...
- Eventually, I plan to make this program into a fully-fledged broadcast-grade multimedia presentation software for use in the home, church, and school. The workplace and businesses has had too much of their technology love, so we're catering a prosumer market.
## The Future - 2024 Update
Portions of this code will be selected as a candidate for the av-mpc project as being internally conceptualized.
